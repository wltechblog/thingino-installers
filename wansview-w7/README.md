# This image will upgrade your camera from factory firmware to Thingino. Don't try to use this for upgrading afterwards!

# This is for the usb powered wifi models, not the SOLAR or 4G LTE versions which are unsupported!

# NOTE

These instructions are the *initial flash* from factory firmware to Thingino, and should not be confused with the instructions for unbricking!

The images in the installers are updated around once a week, you probably want to do a full upgrade after installing!

# SD card install instructions:

1. Identify your hardware and download the matching installer image
2. Use Raspberry pi Imager (or Rufus!) to burn that image to your SD card
3. Insert the SD card
4. Power up the cam and wait a few minutes, you should see the new wifi network you can connect to and configure the camera

## Troubleshooting

### After I plug it in, a blue led is ON for a while and the motors rotate but i have no WiFi network to connect
This means that your cam is booting but fails to setup the WiFi hotspot. Your cam is NOT bricked :)
You may have installed the firmware with the wrong WiFi chipset (or maybe there's a new chipset that we don't cover yet).

### After I plug it in, the motors never rotate
Your cam is bricked, but don't worry! You can follow this tutorial to unbrick it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQa9lV9r4_g
