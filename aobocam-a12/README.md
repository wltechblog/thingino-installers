# Aobocam A12

# THIS IS NOT A GOOD CAMERA. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA INTENDING TO RUN THINGINO.
This image and method is provided for people who already own this camera and want to experiment, but it is extremely limited
and will not be a good out of the box experience with Thingino. If you bought an A12 with the intention or installing
Thingino, my best recommendation is that you return it to wherever you bought it from.

## This image will upgrade your camera from factory firmware to Thingino. It won't work for upgrading afterwards.

The images in the installers are updated once a week, you probably want to do a full upgrade after installing!


## This process is reversible

The first step of this installer will create a backup of your factory firmware, which can be used to revert back to the original firmware if you need to.  
The factory firmware file is named "factory.bin" and will be in "backup/".

## Installation Steps

1. Download the zip file for the Aobocam a12 from this repository
2. Use a sd image burning software such as Rufus, Etcher, or Raspberry Pi Imager to write the image to your sd card (any card 128MB or larger)
3. Power off your camera and insert the sd card, thn power it on
4. Wait around 3-4 minutes and you should see the camera's new wireless network for provisioning it.

#### Important note
> This camera has very low memory, which might cause it to crash after few minutes after booting thingino.  
> To solve the issue, just reboot it, access its web UI and adjust these settings:
> - Disable OSD for all the stream channels
> - Lower the resolution of the main channel
